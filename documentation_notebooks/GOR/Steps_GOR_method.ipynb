    "**Q:** When calculating the frequency for the different amino acids and conformations the total number that I’m dividing by is different for the 3 windows positions? Or is it always the same? \n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** in principle it should be different because you’re always observing less like minus 1 or minus d or plus d windows. In order to get proper probabilities you should divide by the times of numbers you see a -k position or a + k position. To be sure that you are getting ‘proper probabilities’ the best thing to do is dividing by the sum of the counts computed by the overall matrix.  If I have the matrix for the marginal probability- \n",
    "For a windows size 3 you observe at position R-1 and the position R+1 a number of times which (n-1) times where n is the total number of residues used in the training. So n should be the number you obtain when summing the #R_0 row (so total number of residues). If you sum #R_-1 you will get (n-1).\n",
    "Thus in order to get a proper normalization matrix is to take the final #R (marginal probability) matrix and then sum each row #R_d. Each row will yield a different value. These values are then used to normalize their corresponding rows.  → R_ss_-1/sum(#R_-1). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Ah so I cannot use the total count for normalizing each window position? \n",
    "\n",
    "**A** NO! If you have many sequences: This would be n-(n*d) so its a but difficult to be computed. The easiest way is to scan the entire training set: then compute all the counts R_H, R_E, R_C, #R, #SS. Then look at the #R matrix - sum each row to obtain the n specific to the d position within the window. Each particular n of #R_d must be used to normalize the corresponding positions in all the matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prof Remark; Later on: Even if you use the over-all N your are computing a log odd and the denominator is always the same ⇒ thus not changing the result by much… But to obtain proper probabilities you should divide by window-position-specific sum of n.  E.g n_0 = sum of #R_0 ⇒ divide all H_0, E_0, C_0 rows by n_0. Or n_7 = sum of #R_7 ⇒ divide all H_7, E_7, C_7 by n_7!!!\n",
