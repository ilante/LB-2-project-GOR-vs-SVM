    "\n",
    "* Also known as **holdout dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cross-validation is not sufficient tot estimate unbiased generalization performance.\n",
    "    - Model hyper-parameters are still optimized on the training set through cross-valiation and grid-search\n",
    "    - This may lead to some degree of overfitting on training data\n",
    "    - Using a blind set helps us to generate a 'never-seen-before condition'\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Generation Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structures deposited **after** January 2015\n",
    "     - Release year of JPred4 is 2014\n",
    "* X-ray crystals with resolution < 2,5 $\\overset{\\circ}{A}$\n",
    "* Chain lenght in the range of 50 - 300 residues\n",
    "* Advanced search -> Entry Polymer Types:\n",
    "    - Protein OR Protein/NA \n",
    "* All pairs of sequences within the blind set should share less than 30% sequence identity ('internal redundancy'):\n",
    "- By using ```blastclust``` we can reduce the redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "* When comparing sequences of the blindset with the JPRED set: All pairs (blind - Jpred) have an less than 30% identity  ('external redundancy')\n",
    "- This will be ensured using ```blastp```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final blind set will comprise 150 proteins which will be randomly selected among those that meet the above criteria\n",
